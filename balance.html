                    <h3>Balance is a mobile budgeting app designed to help next-generation budgeting more convenient and stress-free. We want to create a mobile platform for users to easily (1) view and customize budget summary, (2) retain “mindset of budgeting” in a digital space, (3) and manage their transactions and budget plans.</h3>

                        <h3>We created a home screen to showcase user’s budgeting and financial summary in a visual way through graphs and charts. These graphs and charts are like widgets displayed on a vertical dashboard. Users can click on the three circles (meatball menu) on the top right to reorder them or remove them. Users can also tap the “+” circle to select/deselect certain graphs and charts.</h3>

                        <h3>Users can navigate to the Drag & Drop screen to categorize their transactions. They can drag their transactions displayed at the bottom towards a desired category circle. The most recently sorted transaction would show up under the category name with a back arrow for users to easily undo. When a category circle is pressed, users will be directed to a list of transactions sorted under that category. They can also tap the list icon on the top right to view all sorted transactions.</h3>
